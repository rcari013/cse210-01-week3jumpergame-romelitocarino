# Jumper

Are you able to guess the word to not fall by having your parachute be cut off because of wrong guessed letters? Prove yourself if you can take the challenge.



## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 

browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
